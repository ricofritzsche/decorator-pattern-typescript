## About

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically attach new behaviors to objects. Using the analogy of customizing a car with various features, we walk through this pattern, making it easier to grasp and implement.

## Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/): Make sure you have Deno installed. If not, you can download and install from [here](https://deno.land/#installation).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricofritzsche/decorator-pattern-typescript.git
cd decorator-pattern-typescript
```

2. Run the TypeScript file using Deno:
```bash
deno run --allow-read main.ts
```

Note: The --allow-read flag is only necessary if the code reads files, which is common in many Deno projects. Adjust the permissions according to your code's requirements.
Exploring the Code

    main.ts: The entry point where we bring everything together.
